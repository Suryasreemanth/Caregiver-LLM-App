"Normal Text: ABOUT CANCER Normal Text: 7 Heading 1: About Cancer Heading 2: What is Cancer? Normal Text: Cancer is one name for a group of diseases. To understand cancer, you must first Normal Text: understand cells. Cells are the basic building blocks that make up all the tissues and Normal Text: organs in the body. Cells divide to make new cells, and to replace damaged or old cells. Normal Text: Each cell contains genetic material (DNA) that tells the cell when to divide and when to Normal Text: die. Cancer occurs when the DNA becomes damaged and gives the wrong instructions Normal Text: to the cell. The cancer cells grow out of control. Cancer cells divide when they shouldn’t Normal Text: and stay alive longer than they should. Cancer cells can crowd out normal cells. A lump Normal Text: of cancer cells is called a tumor. Tumors can be malignant (fast-growing with a tendency Normal Text: to spread) or benign (slow-growing and do not spread). Heading 2: Types of Childhood Cancer Normal Text: Each type of cancer has its own name, treatment, and prognosis (chance of responding Normal Text: to treatment). Cancer in children can be divided into three groups. Normal Text: · Normal Text: Leukemias Normal Text: (cancers of the blood-forming cells) Normal Text: · Normal Text: Lymphomas Normal Text: (cancers of the lymphatic system) Normal Text: · Normal Text: Solid Normal Text:  Normal Text: tumors Normal Text: (cancers of the bone, muscle, brain, organs, or other tissues in the Normal Text: body) Normal Text: Below is information about some of the more common types of childhood cancer. Your Normal Text: health care team will talk with you about your child’s specific type of cancer. Heading 2: Leukemia Normal Text: Leukemia is a cancer of the blood-forming cells that are produced in the bone marrow. Normal Text: Bone marrow is found in the center of bones and serves as a blood-making “factory.” Normal Text: Three types of blood cells are made in the bone marrow. Red blood cells carry oxygen to Normal Text: the body. White blood cells fight infection. Platelets help stop bleeding. Heading 3: ACUTE LYMPHOBLASTIC LEUKEMIA (ALL) Normal Text: Acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) is a cancer involving the blood-forming cells that Normal Text: normally make a type of white blood cell called a lymphocyte. ALL starts when a Normal Text: single young blood-forming cell, called a lymphoblast, develops a series of mistakes",7,ABOUT CANCER,https://childrens-oncology-handbook.netlify.app/#pf1b

The leukemia cell multiplies Normal Text: uncontrollably, crowding out healthy cells in the bone marrow. The leukemia cells can Normal Text: also spill out into the bloodstream, and spread to the lymph nodes, spleen, liver, and Normal Text: other organs. Leukemia cells can also spread to the spinal fluid (the fluid that surrounds Normal Text: the brain and spinal cord). These cells can be detected by looking at the spinal fluid Normal Text: through a microscope after doing a lumbar puncture (sometimes called spinal tap). In Normal Text: boys, leukemia cells can also spread to the testicles, causing the testicles to become Normal Text: swollen, but this is uncommon. Normal Text: There are different types of ALL, named for the type of lymphocyte that is affected. The Normal Text: two major types of lymphocytes are B-cells and T-cells. The most common type of ALL Normal Text: affects B-cell lymphocytes as they are developing. This type of ALL is called precursor-B Normal Text: cell ALL. Another type of ALL affects T-cell lymphocytes as they are developing. This Normal Text: type of ALL is called T-cell ALL. Knowing the type of ALL can be important in guiding Normal Text: treatment. Normal Text: ALL is the most common type of childhood cancer. About 4 out of every 5 children who Normal Text: have leukemia will have ALL.

The leukemia cells can Normal Text: also spill out into the bloodstream, and spread to the lymph nodes, spleen, liver, and Normal Text: other organs. Leukemia cells can also spread to the spinal fluid (the fluid that surrounds Normal Text: the brain and spinal cord). These cells can be detected by looking at the spinal fluid Normal Text: through a microscope after doing a lumbar puncture (sometimes called spinal tap). Normal Text: Occasionally the leukemia cells can form a lump, called a chloroma, that can occur Normal Text: anywhere in the body. There are many different subtypes of AML. Some of the subtypes Normal Text: of AML are myeloblastic, promyelocytic, and monocytic leukemia. Knowing the type of Normal Text: AML can be important in guiding treatment. Normal Text: About 1 out of every 5 children who have leukemia will have AML. Heading 3: CHRONIC MYELOID LEUKEMIA (CML) Normal Text: Chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) is a slow-growing cancer involving the blood-forming Normal Text: cells that make a type of white blood cell called a granulocyte. CML beings when a Normal Text: blood-forming cell develops a change in its genetic code, creating an abnormality Normal Text: known as the Philadelphia chromosome. The Philadelphia chromosome signals the cell Normal Text: to multiply out of control, generating large numbers of abnormal white blood cells. Normal Text: These abnormal white blood cells build up over time and may spread to other parts of Normal Text: the body, including the spleen. Eventually, these abnormal white blood cells may turn Normal Text: into faster-growing types of leukemia cells. Normal Text: Only about 1 out of every 50 children who have leukemia will have CML. Heading 3: JUVENILE MYELOMONCYTIC LEUKEMIA (JMML) Normal Text: Juvenile myelomonocytic leukemia (JMML) is a rare form of childhood leukemia in which Normal Text: a type of white blood cell, called an immature monocyte, is overproduced by the bone Normal Text: marrow. The large number of immature monocytes crowd out healthy cells in the bone Normal Text: marrow, which can cause fatigue, bleeding, and other symptoms. JMML usually occurs Normal Text: in very young children. Normal Text: Less than 1 in 100 children who have leukemia will have JMML. Heading 2: Lymphoma Normal Text: Lymphoma is a cancer of the lymphatic system. The lymphatic system is an important Normal Text: part of the immune system.

The rapid cell growth Normal Text: leads to enlarged lymph nodes (sometimes called swollen glands) and/or body organs. Normal Text: The symptoms of lymphoma depend on the location of the enlarged lymph nodes and/ Normal Text: or organs. Often, the first sign of the illness is a lump or swelling, which might be found Normal Text: in the neck, groin, or under the arm. Sometimes lymphoma cells cause lymph nodes Normal Text: inside the chest to swell—this can cause coughing or chest pain. Lymphoma cells may Normal Text: cause swelling of the liver or spleen, or enlargement of abdominal lymph nodes, causing Normal Text: pain. Lymphoma cells can sometimes spread to the bone marrow, causing pain in the Normal Text: bones. There are two main types of lymphoma: Hodgkin lymphoma and non-Hodgkin Normal Text: lymphoma (NHL). Heading 3: HODGKIN LYMPHOMA Normal Text: Hodgkin lymphoma is a type of lymphoma that is identified by the presence of a certain Normal Text: type of cell, called the Reed-Sternberg cell, that can be seen under the microscope. Normal Text: Hodgkin lymphoma usually causes swelling of lymph nodes, most often in the neck and Normal Text: upper body, but swelling can also occur in other areas of the body. Hodgkin lymphoma Normal Text: can sometimes cause other symptoms, such as recurring fevers, drenching night sweats, Normal Text: weight loss, or itching. Hodgkin lymphoma is uncommon in very young children and is Normal Text: more common in teenagers. Normal Text: About 4 out of every 10 children who have lymphoma will have Hodgkin lymphoma. Heading 3: NON-HODGKIN LYMPHOMA (NHL) Normal Text: Non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL) is a group of diseases arising from lymphatic tissues. Normal Text: The specific type of NHL depends on certain characteristics of the lymphoma cells, Normal Text: such as how they look under the microscope. Because lymphatic tissues can be found Normal Text: throughout the body, NHL can begin in almost any part of the body. NHL sometimes Normal Text: spreads to the spinal fluid (the fluid that surrounds the brain and spinal cord), and can Normal Text: be detected by looking at the spinal fluid through a microscope after doing a lumbar Normal Text: puncture (sometimes called spinal tap). Some types of NHL can cause skin rashes and Normal Text: bone pain. In boys, NHL can sometimes spread to the testicles, causing the testicles to Normal Text: become swollen.

Sarcomas begin Normal Text: when a change or mutation occurs in one of these young cells, allowing the cell to grow Normal Text: uncontrollably and form cancerous tumors. There are many types of sarcomas that occur Normal Text: during childhood. Normal Text: About 12 in every 100 children with cancer will have a sarcoma. Normal Text: · Normal Text: Osteosarcoma Normal Text: (sometimes called osteogenic sarcoma) is the most common cancer Normal Text: of the bone. Osteosarcoma starts when a change or mutation occurs in a young Normal Text: cell within the bone. The change allows the cell to grow uncontrollably and form Normal Text: cancerous tumors that can weaken the bone, cause pain, and spread to other parts Normal Text: of the body, such as the lungs. Osteosarcoma most often affects the bones of the Normal Text: arms and legs, particularly around the knee joint and in the upper arm near the Normal Text: shoulder, but can also occur in any bone in the body. Osteosarcoma most commonly Normal Text: affects teenagers and young adults, but it can occasionally occur in younger children. Normal Text: · Normal Text: Ewing sarcoma Normal Text: is the second most common tumor of the bone. Other names Normal Text: for Ewing sarcoma are “Ewing sarcoma family tumor” and “peripheral primitive Normal Text: neuroectodermal tumor (pPNET).” It often affects the bones of the pelvis, chest, arms, Normal Text: and legs, but can occur in any bone in the body. Ewing sarcoma can also begin in the Normal Text: soft tissues instead of in the bone. Ewing sarcoma most often occurs in older children Normal Text: and teenagers. Normal Text: · Normal Text: Rhabdomyosarcoma Normal Text: is a cancer that arises from cells that normally develop Normal Text: into muscle cells. Rhabdomyosarcoma begins when a change or mutation occurs Normal Text: in one of these young cells, called a rhabdomyoblast, allowing the cell to grow Normal Text: uncontrollably and form a cancerous tumor. Rhabdomyosarcoma may arise virtually Normal Text: anywhere in the body, but some of the most common sites for this tumor are: Normal Text: · Around the eye (orbital) Normal Text: · In the face near the lower part of the skull (parameningeal) Normal Text: · In the face or neck, but far from the lower part of the skull (non- Normal Text: parameningeal) Normal Text: · Arms and legs (extremities) Normal Text: · Urinary system and reproductive organs such as the bladder, prostate, paratestis Normal Text: (near the testicle) and vagina (genitourinary)",18,ABOUT CANCER,https://childrens-oncology-handbook.netlify.app/#pf26

Normal Text: · Normal Text: Non-rhabdomyosarcoma soft tissue sarcomas Normal Text: (NRSTS) are cancers that arise from Normal Text: young cells that normally develop into supporting structures of the body such as Normal Text: tendons, joint linings, and nerve coverings (often called soft tissues). In children, the Normal Text: most common types are synovial sarcoma, malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumor Normal Text: (MPNST), and undifferentiated sarcoma. However, there are at least 30 other types. Normal Text: NRSTS usually develop in the arms or legs, but can arise anywhere in the body. In Normal Text: childhood, they are most common in adolescents. Depending on the particular type, Normal Text: NRSTS can spread to lymph nodes, lungs, bone, skin, and brain. Normal Text: · Normal Text: Desmoplastic small round cell tumor Normal Text: is a rare type of soft tissue sarcoma that is Normal Text: treated differently than other non-rhabdomyosarcoma soft tissue sarcomas (NRSTS). Normal Text: It usually occurs in the abdomen and can spread to the lymph nodes and the lining Normal Text: of the abdomen. It can also spread to the lungs, liver and bones.

Normal Text: · Normal Text: Desmoid tumors Normal Text: are often called “desmoid fibromatosis” or “aggressive Normal Text: fibromatosis.” They usually occur in the arms and legs, but can start anywhere in the Normal Text: body. These tumors do not spread to other parts of the body but can arise in several Normal Text: different places (multifocal) at the same time. Heading 3: CARCINOMAS Normal Text: Carcinomas are cancers that begin in the epithelial tissues (tissues that cover the Normal Text: external surfaces of the body or that form the lining of glands or internal body cavities). Normal Text: Carcinomas are uncommon during childhood. Normal Text: · Normal Text: Adrenocortical carcinoma Normal Text: is a cancer of the adrenal gland. The adrenal glands Normal Text: are located on top of the kidneys. The outer layer of the adrenal gland is called the Normal Text: adrenal cortex. The adrenal cortex makes hormones that help to balance salt and Normal Text: water in the body, control blood pressure, and contribute to masculine or feminine Normal Text: characteristics.

Normal Text: · Normal Text: Renal Cell Carcinoma Normal Text: (See Kidney Cancers, page 16) Heading 3: THYROID CANCER Normal Text: The thyroid gland is a butterfly-shaped organ that sits below the “Adam’s apple” in the Normal Text: front of the neck. The thyroid gland makes hormones that regulate temperature, energy Normal Text: level, weight, and appetite. Thyroid cancer begins when a change or mutation in a cell Normal Text: within the thyroid gland causes the cell to multiply uncontrollably and form lumps of Normal Text: cancerous cells called tumors. A cancerous thyroid tumor is called thyroid carcinoma. Normal Text: There are four types of thyroid cancer: Normal Text: · Papillary (most common type, usually slow growing) Normal Text: · Follicular (less common, usually slow growing) Normal Text: · Medullary (tends to spread to other parts of the body) Normal Text: · Anaplastic (fastest growing) Normal Text: Thyroid cancer is rare in children, and is more likely to occur in older children and Normal Text: teenagers than in younger children. Only about 1 in every 100 children who have cancer Normal Text: will have thyroid cancer. Heading 2: How is Cancer Diagnosed?

"Normal Text: ABOUT CANCER Normal Text: 21 Heading 4: For more information about the tests commonly used to diagnose cancer, see the Heading 4: “Tests and Procedures” section of this Handbook. Heading 2: Cancer Staging for Lymphomas and Solid Tumors Normal Text: Once the diagnosis is made, cancer staging is done for children with lymphomas and Normal Text: solid tumors. Staging is the way that the doctor finds out where the cancer is in the Normal Text: body. To determine the stage of your child’s cancer, the health care provider will order a Normal Text: number of tests. Once the stage of the cancer is known, you and your child’s health care Normal Text: team can talk about the best treatment plan. Normal Text: The site where the cancer started is called the primary tumor. Cancer cells may spread to Normal Text: tissue around the primary tumor (local invasion) or break away and spread to other parts Normal Text: of the body (metastasis). Sites where the cancer has spread are called metastatic tumors. Normal Text: Systems for staging cancer are different for different types of cancer. As a general rule, Normal Text: stage I is the least advanced (meaning that the cancer has not spread beyond the area Normal Text: where it started) and stage IV is the most advanced (meaning that the cancer has spread Normal Text: to distant parts of the body). Treatment is often different for different stages of disease. Normal Text: Therefore, your child’s doctor may need to know the stage of your child’s cancer before Normal Text: treatment recommendations can be made. Heading 2: Causes of Childhood Cancer Normal Text: Many parents wonder what caused their child’s cancer. A very small number of Normal Text: childhood cancers are caused by hereditary factors. This means that the child was born Normal Text: with a change in their DNA (the material inside every cell that tells the cell how to Normal Text: behave) that can cause some cells to develop into a cancer. Sometimes, this change Normal Text: in the DNA occurs in the early stages of development (before the child was born). Normal Text: Other times, this change of DNA is inherited from one of the child’s parents. When Normal Text: this happens, the parent may also have had the same type or a similar type of cancer. Normal Text: Childhood cancers that can be hereditary include retinoblastoma, malignant peripheral Normal Text: nerve sheath tumor, and adrenocortical carcinoma. Most other cancers are not Normal Text: hereditary. Normal Text: Many parents fear that something they did or did not do caused their child’s cancer to Normal Text: develop. As far as we know, nothing that you or your child did caused or could have Normal Text: prevented the cancer. We know that cancer is not contagious. You cannot catch cancer Normal Text: from another person.",21,ABOUT CANCER,https://childrens-oncology-handbook.netlify.app/#pf29

Normal Text: Below is information on the different types of medicines available to help your child Normal Text: through their tests and procedures. Heading 3: LOCAL ANESTHESIA (NUMBING THE SKIN AND TISSUES) Normal Text: Before a test or procedure is done, a numbing medicine can be used. This medicine Normal Text: may be in the form of a topical cream, patch, spray or other device placed on the skin. Normal Text: The medicine numbs the skin and tissues underneath the skin. For many children this is Normal Text: enough numbing medicine for a needle procedure. When necessary, after the medicine Normal Text: has numbed the surface of the skin, another numbing medicine can also be given using Normal Text: a small needle that is placed a little bit deeper into the tissue. This numbing medicine Normal Text: may burn a little bit at first, but after one to two minutes, the tissue will feel numb all Normal Text: the way down to the bone. Heading 3: SEDATION Normal Text: If more than local anesthesia (numbing the skin and tissues) is needed, your health Normal Text: care team will talk with you about sedation (using medicine, or a combination of Normal Text: medicines, to help your child relax or sleep through the test or procedure.) Sedation Normal Text: can be delivered at different levels, ranging from a feeling of calm, to sleepiness, to Normal Text: general anesthesia (completely asleep). The level of sedation will depend on your child’s Normal Text: condition, procedure anxiety, and hospital guidelines. Whatever the level of sedation Normal Text: your child needs, the goal is the same: to keep your child comfortable and free from Normal Text: pain.

Contrast dye helps distinguish normal structures from cancer. Normal Text: Some children need sedation to be able to lie still for the whole scan. Heading 3: MAGNETIC RESONANCE IMAGING (MRI) Normal Text: An MRI uses a special machine (scanner) to look inside the body. The scanner uses Normal Text: magnetic waves to create a picture of the inside of the body. Your child will need to lie Normal Text: still on the table inside the MRI machine while the pictures are made. Normal Text: Your child should not wear anything metal (jewelry, belt, etc.) because the machine Normal Text: attracts metal.

New clinical trials are planned based on the results Normal Text: of past trials, taking the best known therapy and asking what might make it better. Normal Text: Every trial is reviewed by many experts who come from both inside of the COG and Normal Text: from outside agencies like the National Cancer Institute, Hospital Review Boards, and a Normal Text: Data Safety Monitoring Board. The knowledge gained from clinical trials has improved Normal Text: treatment for children with cancer by increasing survival rates and reducing side effects Normal Text: and long-term effects of therapy. Most children with cancer are treated on a clinical trial. Heading 3: NON-THERAPEUTIC TRIALS Normal Text: These trials help us learn more about childhood cancer by studying the: Normal Text: · Biology and behavior of cancer cells Normal Text: · Side effects of cancer treatments and how to reduce them Normal Text: · Causes of childhood cancer and the number of children affected per year Normal Text: · Quality of life during and after cancer treatment Normal Text: ·  Genetic make-up of a person and how that can affect the chance of getting cancer Normal Text: and the response to cancer treatment",33,CLINICAL TRIALS,https://childrens-oncology-handbook.netlify.app/#pf39

"Normal Text: CLINICAL Normal Text: TRIALS Normal Text: 38 Heading 2: How are Clinical Trials Reviewed? Normal Text: After a review by experts in the Children’s Oncology Group (COG), a trial is sent to Normal Text: the National Cancer Institute (NCI) for approval. Once approved by the NCI, the trial is Normal Text: sent to an Institutional Review Board (IRB). An IRB is a committee that includes health Normal Text: professionals and people from the community who were not involved in designing the Normal Text: clinical trial. The IRB reviews a clinical trial to make sure that the rights of people who Normal Text: are in clinical trials are protected.

The other plan or Normal Text: plans have slight changes or additions that may improve survival rates, control disease Normal Text: longer, cause fewer or less serious side effects, and/or decrease days spent in the Normal Text: hospital. To learn if one treatment is better, each child is assigned randomly to one of Normal Text: the treatment plans by a computer. Randomization is a process like flipping a coin that Normal Text: assures each child has a fair and equal chance of being assigned to any of the treatment Normal Text: plans. Participants in randomized clinical trials, and their health care team, cannot Normal Text: choose which treatment they receive. Normal Text: In most clinical trials, we do not know which treatment plan is better until all of the Normal Text: children on the trial have completed treatment and have been followed for several Normal Text: years.

"Normal Text: TREATMENT + Normal Text: EFFECTS Normal Text: 41 Heading 1: Treatment and Effects Heading 2: How Is Cancer Treated? Normal Text: Each type of childhood cancer may be treated differently, depending on what Normal Text: researchers have found to be the most effective treatment for the particular type of Normal Text: cancer. The most common types of cancer treatment are described in the following Normal Text: section. Your child may receive one or a combination of the following treatments at Normal Text: different time points in their therapy. Heading 3: CHEMOTHERAPY Normal Text: Chemotherapy is medicine that treats cancer by stopping cells from growing or by Normal Text: destroying cells. Several types of chemotherapy medicines may be used because they Normal Text: each stop cell growth or destroy cells in a different way. When chemotherapy destroys Normal Text: cancer cells, healthy cells may also be damaged. Damage to healthy cells can cause side Normal Text: effects. Often the side effects get better or go away once the chemotherapy treatment is Normal Text: over. See pages 50–61 for more information about side effects of chemotherapy. Normal Text: Chemotherapy can be given by: Normal Text: · Mouth Normal Text: · Into a vein Normal Text: · Into the muscle Normal Text: · Into the spinal fluid Normal Text: Your child’s chemotherapy may be given by one or more of these Normal Text: methods. How your child’s chemotherapy will be given depends on the type of cancer Normal Text: being treated and the chemotherapy medicines that work best for that type of cancer. Normal Text: The schedule for your child’s chemotherapy will be explained to you by the health Normal Text: care team. Chemotherapy is often given in cycles. A cycle is a period of chemotherapy Normal Text: treatment followed by a period of rest. The rest period allows time for the body to Normal Text: build healthy new cells before the next treatment. For example, your child may receive Normal Text: chemotherapy for one week followed by two weeks of rest. These three weeks make up Normal Text: one cycle.

Radiation may be given by itself or in combination Normal Text: with other therapies, such as chemotherapy and surgery. Radiation can damage both Normal Text: healthy cells and cancer cells, but the healthy cells are better at healing themselves. Normal Text: Unlike chemotherapy, radiation does not cause cell damage throughout the body. Normal Text: Radiation only damages cells in the area of the body where the radiation is given. Normal Text: Radiation therapy can be delivered externally or internally. External beam radiation is Normal Text: the most common delivery method used for children with cancer. This method uses a Normal Text: machine to deliver high energy beams to a specific part of the body.

They will explain which Normal Text: method of radiation delivery is best for your child, along with the risks and benefits. Normal Text: A simulation session will be done before treatment starts. A simulation is when the Normal Text: radiation field (area to receive radiation) will be precisely determined.

Usually tiny permanent ink dots (tattoos) are made to mark Normal Text: the area receiving radiation. Your child’s radiation oncologist will explain the type of Normal Text: markings that will be used for your child. Normal Text: Your child will need to lie still during the time that the radiation treatment is given. Many Normal Text: young children are able to do this successfully after receiving coaching and preparation Normal Text: from their treatment team. If your child is very young or unable to lie still, they may Normal Text: be given medicine (sedation or general anesthesia) so that they are asleep while the Normal Text: radiation treatment is being given. Normal Text: Radiation can make the skin sensitive in the area of the body being treated. You can Normal Text: clean your child’s skin with mild soap and water. Discuss with your radiation care Normal Text: provider which creams or powders should be used on your child’s skin for protection Normal Text: from the radiation effects. Heading 3: SURGERY Normal Text: Different types of surgery are used to treat cancer. Sometimes, taking out the tumor may Normal Text: be the only treatment needed, but usually chemotherapy or radiation is also used to kill Normal Text: any remaining cancer cells. Most surgeries take place in the operating room while your Normal Text: child is asleep under general anesthesia. Normal Text: Primary surgery Normal Text: Primary surgery removes all or most of the tumor at the time of diagnosis. Sometimes, Normal Text: due to tumor size or its location in the body, the tumor cannot be safely removed right Normal Text: away. In this case, chemotherapy or radiation may be given before surgery to help shrink Normal Text: the tumor and make it easier to remove. Normal Text: Second look surgery Normal Text: Second look surgery is performed after treatment with chemotherapy and/or radiation. Normal Text: Surgeons are able to see how well the treatments have worked in killing the cancer cells, Normal Text: and may be able to remove any remaining tumor. Normal Text: Supportive care surgery Normal Text: Supportive care surgery is done to help your child through their cancer treatment. If Normal Text: treatment makes it difficult for your child to eat, a feeding tube may be placed into Normal Text: your child’s stomach or digestive tract until they are able to take enough nutrition by Normal Text: mouth.

The bone marrow Normal Text: makes three types of blood cells. Red blood cells carry oxygen to the body. White blood Normal Text: cells fight germs and infections. Platelets help stop bleeding. Leukemia is a cancer of Normal Text: the cells that make blood. Leukemia cells are sick white blood cells that do not work Normal Text: properly and crowd out healthy blood cells.

The immune system finds cells Normal Text: that are not healthy or cells that do not belong in the body and destroys them. The Normal Text: immune system stores fighter cells, called lymphocytes, in lymphoid tissues in the body. Normal Text: Lymphoma is a cancer of the immune system and lymphoid tissues. The sick lymphoma Normal Text: cells do not work properly to protect the body and they crowd out healthy cells of the Normal Text: immune system. Normal Text: Solid Tumors Normal Text: Begin by explaining the normal job of the area of the body where the cancer is located. Normal Text: (For example, talk about how leg bones support your body and help you walk and do Normal Text: the things you like to do.)

Normal Text: Be specific about the types of treatment your child will receive. Explain that other Normal Text: children with different types of cancer may receive different types of treatment or Normal Text: different amounts of the same treatment. The most common types of treatment are Normal Text: described below. Normal Text: Chemotherapy Normal Text: Chemotherapy, often called “chemo,” is medicine that gets rid of fast growing cells. Normal Text: Cancer cells grow very fast. Chemotherapy is given to get rid of cancer cells. Our bodies Normal Text: also have healthy cells that grow fast. Chemotherapy sometimes hurts healthy cells too, Normal Text: but the healthy cells usually get better after therapy is completed. Normal Text: When chemotherapy affects healthy cells, children may have side effects such as hair Normal Text: loss, upset stomach, mouth sores, fever, tiredness, or infection. Not all children have all Normal Text: of these side effects. The side effects that your child may have depend on the type of Normal Text: medicine that they get. Your health care team will talk with you about what to expect Normal Text: based on your child’s treatment plan. Normal Text: Radiation Normal Text: Radiation uses strong energy beams that you cannot see or feel. Machines focus these Normal Text: beams on the area of the body where the cancer is located. Radiation destroys cancer Normal Text: cells to stop them from growing and spreading. Radiation can also hurt healthy cells that Normal Text: are close to the cancer, but the healthy cells usually get better after therapy is completed. Normal Text: When radiation hurts healthy cells, children may have side effects such as hair loss, Normal Text: upset stomach, vomiting, mouth sores, tiredness, fever, and redness of the skin. Not all Normal Text: children have all of these side effects. The side effects that your child may have depend Normal Text: on the place where the radiation is given and the dose of radiation. Your health care Normal Text: team will be able to discuss with you what to expect based on your child’s treatment Normal Text: plan. Normal Text: Surgery Normal Text: During surgery, a doctor takes out all or part of the cancer. Surgery may also be done Normal Text: to give the child a tube (central line) for getting intravenous medicines and fluids during Normal Text: treatment. Some children also have surgery for placement of a feeding tube (G-tube) to Normal Text: help them get the nutrition they need during their treatment.

Children with cancer may feel angry, guilty, sad, lonely, and scared, but many Normal Text: times they will also feel happy. Assure your child that any feelings they have are normal. Normal Text: Young children often benefit from learning names for their feelings. Normal Text: Be honest with your child about your feelings. Children can sense when something is Normal Text: bothering you. Sharing your feelings with your child tells them that it is okay to feel Normal Text: upset or angry.

Normal Text: · How will my child feel about the treatment? Normal Text: · How can I support my child? Normal Text: Children of different ages understand and react differently to cancer and its treatment. Normal Text: Your child’s personality, normal coping style, support system, treatment plan, as well as Normal Text: age or developmental level will affect how your child copes with cancer. Normal Text: When children are faced with stress, their normal behaviors may change.

Normal Text: Check with your health care team if your other children are due to receive live vaccines, Normal Text: such as MMR or varicella, to be sure there are no restrictions. Heading 3: SKIN CARE Normal Text: Chemotherapy and radiation can affect the skin. Some medicines (such as methotrexate, Normal Text: doxorubicin, busulfan, thiotepa, Bactrim™ and Septra Normal Text: ® Normal Text: ) and radiation make the skin Normal Text: more sensitive to sunlight. Any area of the skin that receives radiation will always be Normal Text: sensitive to sunlight. Sunburn can lead to blisters, which can get infected. Skin damage Normal Text: from the sun can also lead to skin cancer. Normal Text: Remember to protect children from sunburn when the skin is exposed to the sun, even Normal Text: on cloudy or hazy days. Sand, snow, concrete, water, and high altitudes all increase the Normal Text: risk of sun damage. When outdoors, your child should wear protective clothing (hat, Normal Text: long pants, long sleeves) and sunscreen (look for SPF 35 or higher on the label).

While some of these products may be safe, Normal Text: some natural products and vitamins may interfere with how well chemotherapy works. Normal Text: Herbal and natural products may contain bacteria or fungi, increasing your child’s risk for Normal Text: infection. Some products may have side effects that can interfere with cancer treatment. Normal Text: It is very important to talk with your child’s health care team before giving your child any Normal Text: vitamins, remedies, or other natural products. Normal Text: Other CAM Therapies Normal Text: Some types of CAM therapy may be helpful in managing the symptoms related to Normal Text: cancer treatment. Some CAM therapies are designed to reduce stress and help the child Normal Text: with cancer feel more relaxed and comfortable. Examples of CAM therapies that are Normal Text: sometimes used in children with cancer include yoga, imagery, art therapy, meditation,",79,CARING FOR YOUR CHILD + FAMILY,https://childrens-oncology-handbook.netlify.app/#pf6b

Talk with your health care team about any Normal Text: type of CAM therapy that you would like to use in your child’s care. It is important for Normal Text: your child’s health care providers to be aware of all types of therapies that your child is Normal Text: receiving in order to provide your child with the safest and most effective care possible. Heading 3: NUTRITION Normal Text: A healthy diet is an important part of helping your child’s body to grow, heal, and work Normal Text: well. The body needs protein, carbohydrates, fats, vitamins, and minerals. As your child Normal Text: progresses through treatment, their appetite will change. Cancer treatment can cause Normal Text: changes in taste. For example, your child may complain that some foods have a metallic Normal Text: taste, and their usual food preferences may change. Normal Text: Steroids may cause your child to overeat and temporarily gain weight. In some cases, Normal Text: your health care team may want to limit further weight gain. You can talk with your Normal Text: health care provider or dietitian if you are worried about your child’s weight gain. Normal Text: Together, you can make a plan to help your child get enough to eat, but with less fat Normal Text: and calories. Normal Text: You may notice changes in your child’s appetite and food choices. Your child may not Normal Text: like a past favorite food. New foods may taste good. Avoid forcing any food on your Normal Text: child. The appetite usually returns to normal after a specific phase of treatment is over. Normal Text: If your child cannot eat enough by mouth to keep the body working well, a special Normal Text: nutrient formula may be given through a tube. The tube may be placed in the nose and Normal Text: go into the stomach (N.G. tube or nose tube). A tube can also be surgically placed right Normal Text: into the stomach through the wall of the abdomen (G-tube or “PEG”). The formula will Normal Text: give your child fluid, calories, protein, vitamins, and minerals. Some of these formulas Normal Text: are available at the grocery store, such as Pediasure Normal Text: ® Normal Text: . Others may be supplied by the Normal Text: hospital. If your child has a feeding tube, you will be taught how to use the tube at Normal Text: home. Normal Text: If your child cannot tolerate tube feedings or there is another medical reason to prevent Normal Text: the use of a tube, a different nutrient solution can be given through an I.V. This special Normal Text: solution is often called total parenteral nutrition (TPN or “hyperal”). TPN is made of two Normal Text: liquids. One is a yellow liquid that contains protein, carbohydrate, minerals, vitamins, Normal Text: and electrolytes. The other is a white liquid that contains fats. TPN can be given at home. Normal Text: In general, TPN will only be used if your child has nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, or another Normal Text: medical problem that prevents the use of feeding through a tube. Heading 3: CARING FOR CENTRAL LINES Normal Text: Special care is needed to prevent the central line from becoming infected. Always wash Normal Text: your hands before touching the line or dressing. Carefully follow all instructions from",80,CARING FOR YOUR CHILD + FAMILY,https://childrens-oncology-handbook.netlify.app/#pf6c
"Normal Text: CARING FOR Normal Text: YOUR CHILD + Normal Text: FAMILY Normal Text: 81 Normal Text: your health care team about caring for your child’s central line. These may include Normal Text: instructions for changing the dressing, flushing the line, and giving medicines.

If you Normal Text: see a break or leak in the line, clamp the line above the break right away. Take your child Normal Text: to the hospital right away to have the line fixed. Normal Text: If you are flushing the line and you feel resistance (fluid is hard to push in), do not force Normal Text: it. Check to make sure the line is not twisted or clamped and try again. If you still feel Normal Text: resistance, call your health care provider. Heading 4: For more information about central lines, see page 44 of this handbook. For Heading 4: more information about caring for central lines at your hospital, talk with your Heading 4: health care team. Heading 3: SCHOOL Normal Text: During treatment, your child needs to continue to learn, grow, and interact with their Normal Text: peers (friends). Going to school is an important part of your child returning to a normal Normal Text: routine. School also helps children to feel good about themselves and hopeful for the Normal Text: future. Your health care provider will talk with you when your child is ready to go back Normal Text: to school. To help ease the transition, your child life specialist or another member of your Normal Text: health care team may be able to go to your child’s school to talk with the classmates Normal Text: and explain what cancer is and how it is treated. Tell your child’s teacher to call you if Normal Text: any child in the class gets a contagious illness like chickenpox. Normal Text: Many children find it hard to go back to school, especially Normal Text: if they have changes in their body. Hair loss and weight Normal Text: loss or weight gain are common concerns. Tell your Normal Text: health care provider if your child is worried about going Normal Text: back to school. Your child life specialist, social worker, Normal Text: psychologist or nurse may be able to help. If your child Normal Text: is having problems doing school work, ask for extra Normal Text: help. Two laws in the United States allow for children Normal Text: with cancer to get a special education plan, which may Normal Text: include extra help. These laws are called IDEA (Individuals",81,CARING FOR YOUR CHILD + FAMILY,https://childrens-oncology-handbook.netlify.app/#pf6d
"Normal Text: CARING FOR Normal Text: YOUR CHILD + Normal Text: FAMILY Normal Text: 82 Normal Text: with Disabilities Education Act) and Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act. Talk with Normal Text: someone from your health care team to see how these laws, or the laws in your country, Normal Text: may apply to your child. Normal Text: If your child is not able to go to school, talk with your child’s teacher. Your health care Normal Text: provider can write a letter to the school to explain your child’s diagnosis and treatment. Normal Text: Your child’s teacher can send schoolwork home and find ways to keep your child in Normal Text: touch with the other children in the class. Your school may also provide homebound Normal Text: instruction, if needed. A tutor may come to your home to help your child with school Normal Text: work. Heading 2: Caring for the Whole Family Heading 3: COPING WITH YOUR FEELINGS Normal Text: Since the time of your child’s diagnosis, your lives have not been the same. The diagnosis Normal Text: of cancer brings changes to your life and the lives of the whole family. Every family is Normal Text: different. Each family has ways to cope with stressful experiences. Many families have Normal Text: told us about feeling fear, anger, depression, and guilt. All these feelings are common Normal Text: human emotions. You are not alone. Talking with family and friends, a member of Normal Text: the health care team, or another parent of a child who has cancer may be helpful. Normal Text: By sharing these feelings, you may find it easier to cope with the changes you are Normal Text: experiencing. Normal Text: Fear Normal Text: The time of diagnosis is often the most difficult. The fear of the unknown and what a Normal Text: cancer diagnosis means for your child may be overwhelming. This experience may be Normal Text: your child’s first hospitalization. Dealing with the stress of your child adapting to a new Normal Text: and sometimes frightening environment may be difficult. Normal Text: You may also have fears about treatment, finances, or how you will help your child to Normal Text: cope with cancer. Talking about these fears and getting them out in the open can be Normal Text: helpful. The health care team is here to listen to your concerns and help you. Normal Text: Anger Normal Text: At times you may feel very angry at what is happening. Some families are angry with Normal Text: God or fate for singling them out. Some are mad at the health care team for not Normal Text: finding an answer to what is happening with their child. You may even feel angry with Normal Text: your child for getting sick and turning your life upside down. Feeling angry is a normal Normal Text: reaction. However, taking your anger out by yelling, fighting or other violent actions is Normal Text: not a healthy way of coping. Finding a safe outlet to let off steam may be helpful.",82,CARING FOR YOUR CHILD + FAMILY,https://childrens-oncology-handbook.netlify.app/#pf6e
"Normal Text: CARING FOR Normal Text: YOUR CHILD + Normal Text: FAMILY Normal Text: 83 Normal Text: For example, some parents find that taking a walk or talking with a trusted friend helps Normal Text: ease the tension. Many parents also find it helpful to talk with a psychologist, social Normal Text: worker, or chaplain. Normal Text: Guilt Normal Text: Parents often feel guilty for not knowing that their child was sick. Many parents wonder Normal Text: if they did something to cause their child to get cancer. Brothers and sisters may also Normal Text: feel guilty that they are healthy, and they may worry that they caused the illness by Normal Text: something that they did or thought. For example, a brother or sister may be thinking Normal Text: “We had a fight and I wished he would die—and now he has cancer!” Everyone in the Normal Text: family needs to be assured that they did not cause the cancer, nor could they have done Normal Text: anything to prevent it. Normal Text: Depression Normal Text: People use depression to describe a range of emotions and behaviors. Feeling “blue” Normal Text: or sad is a normal reaction to the diagnosis of cancer and the treatment demands. The Normal Text: illness may also require changes in family routine and bring feelings of social isolation. Normal Text: These changes and losses may produce grief reactions. You may notice symptoms of Normal Text: grief, such as crying spells, decreased appetite or compulsive eating, lack of interest, Normal Text: decreased energy, lack of concentration, poor problem solving, and physical symptoms Normal Text: such as tightness in the chest or headaches. Normal Text: With the support of family, friends, and the health care team, most parents are able Normal Text: to work through these emotions and use coping skills that are needed to meet care Normal Text: demands. Individual or family counseling allows parents a way to discover their inner Normal Text: strengths. Sometimes parents find that their emotions are so overwhelming that Normal Text: they feel they cannot cope with the demands being placed on them. When other life Normal Text: stressors, such as loss of a job, moving, marital problems, divorce, emotional problems, Normal Text: or substance abuse existed prior to the diagnosis, the situation may be more difficult. Normal Text: It may help to discuss your feelings with a trusted member of the health care team. Normal Text: Counseling and medications may be needed and are available. Heading 3: COPING WITH YOUR CHILD’S ILLNESS Normal Text: Some suggestions to help you cope with your child’s illness include: Normal Text: · Make a special effort to find private time to talk with your spouse or partner, or with Normal Text: a close friend. Try to talk about things other than your sick child. Normal Text: · Try not to talk about your child in their presence unless they are included in the Normal Text: conversation. Normal Text: · Find ways to reduce stress. Many parents find it helpful to take a walk, read, or Normal Text: spend time with trusted friends. You know what works best for you.",83,CARING FOR YOUR CHILD + FAMILY,https://childrens-oncology-handbook.netlify.app/#pf6f
"Normal Text: CARING FOR Normal Text: YOUR CHILD + Normal Text: FAMILY Normal Text: 84 Normal Text: · Try to take turns with your spouse or other support person when staying with your Normal Text: child in the hospital or coming for clinic visits. Normal Text: · Both parents can be involved with the child’s treatment. Sharing responsibilities Normal Text: reduces the gap that may grow between parents when one is more involved in care Normal Text: than the other. Normal Text: · Allow family members and friends to help. Suggest specific ways that they can Normal Text: help you, such as asking them to shop for groceries, cook, clean, or take your other Normal Text: children to and from school. Normal Text: · Identify a contact person who stays in direct communication with you and is willing Normal Text: to update other family members and friends about your child’s condition. This will Normal Text: save you from repeating the same information over and over to many different Normal Text: people. Some families find it helpful to set up a website, blog, or other method of Normal Text: electronic communication to keep others informed. Normal Text: · Ask a member of the health care team for help and support. Normal Text: · Talk to other parents of children with cancer. Normal Text: · Attend a support group. Normal Text: · Talk to your health care provider about whether or not counseling and/or medication Normal Text: is appropriate for you. Heading 3: IMPACT OF THE CHILD’S CANCER ON A MARRIAGE/RELATIONSHIP Normal Text: A chronic illness can quickly turn a family’s life upside down. Parents often become Normal Text: exhausted trying to cope with the needs of the child and the rest of the family; Normal Text: financial problems are common. Many parents try to continue to work at their jobs Normal Text: and keep the home routine as normal as possible. Many couples feel a strain on their Normal Text: relationship. Parents often say that they do not have time for each other. They may feel Normal Text: angry and frustrated with what has happened to their child. Three things may help Normal Text: prevent the breakdown of a marriage/relationship: respecting coping styles, maintaining Normal Text: communication, and accepting changing roles. Normal Text: Respecting Coping Styles Normal Text: Each person responds differently to stress. Some parents may withdraw, others may cry Normal Text: or get angry, while others may cope by gathering information. Parents need to learn and Normal Text: respect the different ways each has in coping with the child’s illness. Try to understand Normal Text: where your partner is in accepting what is happening. Normal Text: Maintaining Communication Normal Text: The key to any successful relationship is communication. The need to talk about feelings, Normal Text: fears, appreciation, and information is even greater during times of stress.

By sharing feelings and information you can Normal Text: stay connected and be better able to make decisions. Normal Text: Accepting Changing Roles Normal Text: The demands of illness and treatment can change the roles of family members. The Normal Text: change in roles can cause stress within a marriage or family. Some temporary role Normal Text: changes may be necessary to support the ill child. Some role changes may become Normal Text: permanent, if the changes help improve how parents or family members work together. Normal Text: Parents Working Together Normal Text: Some suggestions to help parents work together when they have a child with cancer Normal Text: include: Normal Text: · Learn about the diagnosis and treatment together. Normal Text: · Work together to provide care and attention for your other children. Normal Text: · Share feelings with each other. Normal Text: · Be sympathetic and understanding toward one another, avoiding blame and criticism. Normal Text: · Accept the help of family, friends, and neighbors. Heading 3: SUGGESTIONS FOR SEPARATED OR DIVORCED PARENTS Normal Text: While separation or divorce is difficult for most families, problems may get worse when Normal Text: a child is diagnosed with cancer. The most important thing to help is to stay focused on Normal Text: your ill child and their brothers and sisters. Maintaining this focus can help reduce other Normal Text: problems that may have existed in your family before your child’s diagnosis, or that may Normal Text: become worse after the diagnosis. Normal Text: Family boundaries and routines can become blurred when separated or divorced parents Normal Text: pull together to care for their child after diagnosis. In stepfamilies, it is important for Normal Text: stepparents to allow biological parents time and space to work together to make Normal Text: treatment decisions and to care for the ill child. This can be a hard time for stepparents, Normal Text: as they may be unsure about how to help. It is important to remain flexible and Normal Text: supportive of each other so that you can deal with needed changes to your parenting Normal Text: plans as your child begins treatment. Normal Text: If your relationship with your “ex” is difficult, you may want to seek additional help Normal Text: from your social worker or psychologist to help cope with your feelings. In addition, Normal Text: your child with cancer and your other children may need additional support to cope Normal Text: with these added changes to their family, especially if the separation or divorce recently Normal Text: occurred.",85,CARING FOR YOUR CHILD + FAMILY,https://childrens-oncology-handbook.netlify.app/#pf71
"Normal Text: CARING FOR Normal Text: YOUR CHILD + Normal Text: FAMILY Normal Text: 86 Normal Text: Work together and do not allow the stress of divorce or separation to affect your child’s Normal Text: care. Though the marriage or relationship has ended, your responsibility for parenting Normal Text: continues. Good communication helps parents get the best care for their child. Normal Text: Some suggestions to help avoid problems include: Normal Text: · Remember to focus on your ill child as you negotiate new demands on your Normal Text: relationship and previous shared parenting plans. Normal Text: · Place a copy of divorce decrees, custody, and visitation rights in your child’s medical Normal Text: record. Normal Text: · Meet together with the health care team to avoid confusion about the plan of care. Normal Text: · Ask your health care provider to routinely email both parents important information, Normal Text: especially when both parents cannot attend clinic or hospital visits. This way you will Normal Text: know that you both have received the information accurately. Normal Text: · Ask for two copies of all teaching materials so both parents will have the same Normal Text: information. Normal Text: · Develop a family communication plan to make sure important health information is Normal Text: shared when the child moves between households. Normal Text: · If you or your former partner have remarried, remember to include stepparents in Normal Text: teaching, as they will be involved in caring for the child at home. Normal Text: · Talk with a member of the health care team if you notice changes in your child with Normal Text: cancer, changes in your other children, or if you are having difficulty working with Normal Text: your “ex.” Heading 3: IMPACT OF CANCER ON BROTHERS AND SISTERS Normal Text: Brothers and sisters of a child with cancer may have many different feelings and Normal Text: responses. Often they have needs similar to their sick brother or sister. They may feel Normal Text: upset, scared, and unsure of what the future holds. Brothers and sisters may fear the Normal Text: word cancer and worry about death. Regardless of age, they will sense a change in their Normal Text: family life. Normal Text: While your other children may feel sad and worried about their sick brother or sister, Normal Text: they may also feel some resentment or anger. Mom and Dad are spending all of their Normal Text: time with or talking about the sick child. Friends and family send the sick child gifts Normal Text: and money. The other children in the family, especially Normal Text: young ones, may feel jealous. Brothers and sisters Normal Text: may also feel sad and cry easily.

Normal Text: · Let your other children know they are still loved and important to you. Normal Text: · Explain the diagnosis, treatment, and side effects that their brother or sister may Normal Text: experience. What you tell them will depend on their ages and ability to understand. Normal Text: Assure them that cancer is not contagious and they are not responsible for their Normal Text: brother or sister getting cancer. Normal Text: · Take your other children with you to the hospital to help them feel involved in the Normal Text: care and treatments of your sick child. This may help to decrease their fears and Normal Text: increase feelings of closeness with their brother or sister. Normal Text: · If possible, ask a loving friend or relative to stay in your home, rather than sending Normal Text: your children elsewhere. Normal Text: · Allow your children to help with chores at home. This may help them feel needed Normal Text: and can also help you. Normal Text: · Talk with your children’s teachers. Teachers can be supportive to your children and let Normal Text: you know about any school-related problems. Normal Text: · Ask for help from a member of the health care team, such as a child life specialist, Normal Text: social worker, psychologist, or child psychiatrist. Heading 3: IMPACT OF CANCER ON GRANDPARENTS Normal Text: Grandparents have a variety of responses when they hear that their grandchild has Normal Text: cancer. Like you, they may feel shock and disbelief. Grandparents may feel guilty for Normal Text: living a long life. They may also feel they are responsible, and may worry that they in Normal Text: some way passed cancer through the family. Grandparents may also feel sadness, not Normal Text: just for their grandchild, but for their son or daughter as well. Normal Text: Grandparents can be a great help to you and your family. If they are in good health and Normal Text: can be with you, they can relieve you in the hospital or help you at home. A grandparent Normal Text: may also give your other children the attention, comfort, and love that they need. Normal Text: Grandparents can also serve as contact persons. They can Normal Text: give information to other family members, so you don’t have Normal Text: to spend as much time on the phone or emailing.

"Normal Text: CARING FOR Normal Text: YOUR CHILD + Normal Text: FAMILY Normal Text: 88 Heading 3: DISCIPLINING A CHILD WHO HAS CANCER Normal Text: From the moment a child is diagnosed with cancer, the normal family routine is Normal Text: disrupted. The child becomes the center of attention of family members and friends. Normal Text: Often, the child receives many gifts. Although the child may feel sick, gifts and attention Normal Text: are still fun. Children can get used to being “special” and want the special treatment to Normal Text: continue. Normal Text: Discipline problems are most common when the special attention stops and normal Normal Text: activities resume. The illness itself can also interfere with discipline. Children are likely Normal Text: to act more immature and more dependent when they feel sick. Pain and the side Normal Text: effects of treatment can make any child irritable. Many medicines, such as steroids, can Normal Text: also cause irritability. These behavior changes can make it difficult to know what is Normal Text: reasonable to expect of your child. Normal Text: Many parents feel helpless and guilty when they see their child suffer. You may feel the Normal Text: need to make up for the suffering by giving special privileges. These feelings are normal. Normal Text: However, becoming too lenient can also be a problem. Children expect and need adults Normal Text: to give them structure. Rules and limits provide security. If a parent is too lenient, the Normal Text: child may think the illness is worse than they have been told. The child may even think Normal Text: that the condition is hopeless. Normal Text: Keep in mind the following guidelines when deciding on how you can provide limits for Normal Text: your child: Normal Text: · Set clear, consistent, and age-appropriate limits. Normal Text: · Adjust your expectations to your child’s current condition. If your child is not feeling Normal Text: well, “please” and “thank you” may not be reasonable with every request. Normal Text: · Use alternatives to spanking. Try using a “time out” approach or taking away Normal Text: privileges. Normal Text: · Use praise and attention to reward good behavior. Heading 2: Resources Normal Text: Many resources are available at your hospital and clinic and in your community to Normal Text: help your child and family through this time. Types of resources available may include Normal Text: information, support, financial assistance, housing, and transportation.

Heading 3: DOES MY CHILD STILL NEED TO TAKE BACTRIM™ (SEPTRA Normal Text: ® Heading 3: )?

Heading 3: WHAT DO I DO IF MY CHILD DEVELOPS A FEVER OR BECOMES ILL? Normal Text: In the first few weeks after the end of treatment, your child may still have low blood Normal Text: counts and a central line.

Heading 3: WHEN CAN THE CENTRAL LINE BE REMOVED? Normal Text: Most children have the central line removed soon after treatment ends. Ask your Normal Text: child’s health care team about the right time for your child to have their central line Normal Text: removed. Internal lines (such as a Port-a-Cath Normal Text: ® Normal Text: or Medi-Port) are usually taken out in Normal Text: the procedure room or operating room. External lines (such as a Hickman Normal Text: ® Normal Text: or Broviac Normal Text: ® Normal Text: ) Normal Text: are often removed in the clinic.

If blood drawing becomes a problem, the Normal Text: child life specialist may be able to offer your child help coping with the blood tests. Normal Text: It is important never to be dishonest with your child about an upcoming blood test, Normal Text: as this can lessen their trust in you. At the same time, there is no need to discuss an Normal Text: upcoming blood test weeks before the event. Most child life specialists recommend Normal Text: giving the child a short time to process the information. Your child life specialist can give Normal Text: you other ideas and strategies to help your child better tolerate blood draws. Heading 3: WHY DOES MY CHILD STILL FEEL TIRED? Normal Text: When children finish treatment, fatigue is not uncommon. It takes time to rebuild Normal Text: strength and stamina. Most parents find that this can take several months. Heading 3: HOW OFTEN WILL MY CHILD NEED TO COME BACK TO THE HOSPITAL? Normal Text: When your child completes treatment, they will be seen often in the clinic. Most Normal Text: children treated for leukemia will need a monthly clinic appointment for a review of the Normal Text: child’s progress over the past month, a physical exam and blood counts. Monthly visits Normal Text: generally continue for the first year off treatment. Children treated for a solid tumor may Normal Text: have longer intervals between visits. Your health care team’s preference and the policy of Normal Text: your clinic or hospital may be slightly different. Heading 3: WHAT HAPPENS AT FOLLOW-UP VISITS? Normal Text: The main purpose of follow-up visits during the first year is to be sure that the cancer Normal Text: has not returned and to start the transition to life after cancer. Children will usually have Normal Text: a complete blood count to assure bone marrow recovery after treatment and also may Normal Text: have blood tests to assess the health of other organs, such as the liver and kidneys. A Normal Text: general check up is done by the health care provider, including questions about how Normal Text: your child is doing, and a physical exam. Normal Text: Children who were treated for a solid tumor will have scans performed on a regular Normal Text: basis to ensure that they are free of cancer. The frequency of CT scans, MRIs and other Normal Text: tests depends on the type of cancer and treatment plan. You will usually be given a Normal Text: schedule or calendar of the planned follow-up visits and scans at your first follow-up Normal Text: clinic visit. Heading 3: IS IT OKAY IF I DON’T FEEL LIKE CELEBRATING? Normal Text: Parents and patients find that friends and family members are often overjoyed for them Normal Text: at the end of treatment. You may be greeted with big smiles and told how well your Normal Text: child looks, and you may be asked, “Isn’t it great that your child finished chemo?”",93,AFTER TREATMENT ENDS,https://childrens-oncology-handbook.netlify.app/#pf7b
"Normal Text: AFTER Normal Text: TREATMENT Normal Text: ENDS Normal Text: 94 Normal Text: For many families, but not for all, a celebration feels very appropriate. Your child Normal Text: and family have just gotten through the huge challenge of treatment. That is a great Normal Text: achievement. The celebration might be low-key, such as going to the park on what Normal Text: previously would have been a clinic day. Some families choose to have a family party Normal Text: or celebration at school. Some find that planning an enjoyable vacation gives them Normal Text: something positive to focus on. Other parents find that their own reactions are much Normal Text: more cautious, because they are worried about the future. Even if there are a lot of Normal Text: challenges ahead, you and your child have done something pretty amazing by getting Normal Text: through all the weeks, months or even years of treatment. Give yourself a moment to Normal Text: acknowledge this milestone. Whatever you and your child choose to do will be right Normal Text: for you. Heading 2: Two to Six Months Off Treatment Normal Text: After a few weeks off treatment, most children have normalized blood counts, and the Normal Text: complications of low platelets, low red blood cells and low white counts are decreased. Normal Text: Immune system recovery is progressing, but not yet back to normal. Heading 3: WHERE DID EVERYBODY GO? Normal Text: During active treatment, patients and families regularly see health care professionals and Normal Text: other parents at the hospital. The health care team offers reassurances that your child is Normal Text: doing well, and they are at hand to answer questions or concerns. Other parents can be Normal Text: a comforting source of information. Yet, when treatment is done, you have less contact Normal Text: with these sources of support. Normal Text: Parents sometimes find that even people who seemed to understand what they were Normal Text: going through during treatment are not available as often. Teens may feel that many of Normal Text: their friends have abandoned them. It can be particularly hard at this time to find people Normal Text: who realize the pressures and fears that accompany the post-treatment phase. Normal Text: With a little explanation, or perhaps by lending them this handbook, friends and Normal Text: relatives can come to appreciate that you still have concerns and worries, and better Normal Text: understand your feelings. Some parents create a new support system with online parent Normal Text: groups, or keep in touch with other hospital families via email. Heading 3: WHAT DO I DO IF MY CHILD DEVELOPS A FEVER, OR BECOMES ILL? Normal Text: Check with your child’s health care provider to determine a plan for management of Normal Text: fevers and minor illnesses. Once your child has a normal blood count and the central line Normal Text: or port has been removed, you may be advised to see your family doctor or pediatrician Normal Text: first.

Normal Text: Your child’s immunity will be reduced for up to six months after treatment. Children who Normal Text: have undergone a hematopoietic stem cell transplant may have reduced immunity for Normal Text: a longer period of time. If your child previously needed to take extra medicines when Normal Text: they came into contact with chickenpox or shingles, they will still need these medicines Normal Text: during this time. Heading 3: DOES MY CHILD STILL NEED TO TAKE BACTRIM™ (SEPTRA Normal Text: ® Heading 3: )? Normal Text: Your health care team may stop this medicine after your child has been off treatment for Normal Text: 3 to 6 months. Heading 3: CAN MY CHILD JOIN IN PHYSICAL EDUCATION CLASS AND SWIMMING? Normal Text: Once your child’s central line or port has been removed and the site has healed, there Normal Text: usually are no restrictions on swimming. Exercise is important for health, and unless Normal Text: there are any specific reasons why your child cannot be physically active, daily exercise Normal Text: should be encouraged. Check with your health care team to make sure there are no Normal Text: restrictions on activities. Heading 3: WILL MY CHILD’S HAIR COME BACK? Normal Text: Hair loss, also known as alopecia, is a side effect of some chemotherapy medicines and/ Normal Text: or radiation. Hair will usually grow back when cancer treatment has ended. The hair Normal Text: may be a slightly different color or texture (curlier, thicker, or thinner) than before cancer Normal Text: treatment. In some cases, when a child receives high doses of radiation, as is used for Normal Text: brain tumor therapy, hair may not regrow within the radiation site. Please talk with your Normal Text: health care team about any questions or concerns you may have. Heading 3: WHY AM I ANXIOUS ABOUT COMING BACK TO CLINIC? Normal Text: Coming back to the clinic for checkups can be stressful. Some parents say that they feel Normal Text: increasingly anxious as the day of the appointment gets closer, and then feel much more Normal Text: relaxed afterwards and are able to forget about the disease for awhile. It is good to Normal Text: remember that the chance of a cancer recurrence at any follow-up appointment is very Normal Text: small. Normal Text: Coming back to the clinic brings other stresses, too. It can be hard to see children who Normal Text: are still receiving treatment. This may bring back difficult memories of your own child’s Normal Text: treatment. Returning to the clinic can also mean that parents hear news of children that Normal Text: they knew during treatment. If this news is bad, it is natural that parents can become Normal Text: very fearful for their own child. It is always important to remember that even when Normal Text: children have the same diagnosis, each child’s illness is unique. Talking to your health Normal Text: care team about your concerns may be helpful.",95,AFTER TREATMENT ENDS,https://childrens-oncology-handbook.netlify.app/#pf7d

Normal Text: Parents often tell us that the end of treatment feels like losing the child’s safety net. Normal Text: During treatment families feel that everything possible is being done to beat the Normal Text: disease. Parents sometimes feel that they would prefer their child remain on low dose Normal Text: chemotherapy for life, if it could guarantee that the disease would not return. Normal Text: If you are struggling with fears about relapse, it can be helpful to remember that: Normal Text: · Most childhood cancers do not recur Normal Text: · The chances of relapse decrease the longer your child has been off treatment Normal Text: · For many children, treatment may still be successful if the disease does return Heading 3: WHAT ABOUT BROTHERS AND SISTERS? Normal Text: Like their parents, brothers and sisters of a sick child may continue to have worries about Normal Text: their brother’s or sister’s health for some time after treatment. Many children will also Normal Text: realize that even though treatment is over, parents are still focusing more on the child Normal Text: who has been ill. Brothers and sisters often need reassurance that they are loved equally. Normal Text: As brothers and sisters get older, they are likely to need more detailed explanations Normal Text: about the illness, as well as reassurance that the risk of cancer is not increased for them. Heading 3: WHEN WILL LIFE GET BACK TO NORMAL? Normal Text: Of course, life will never return to exactly the way it was before your child became ill. Normal Text: However, most parents feel that, in time, the family reaches a “new normal.” For some Normal Text: parents, returning to work can feel like a huge step. If you have not seen co-workers Normal Text: since before your child was ill, coping with their reactions can be a challenge. Some Normal Text: parents have found it helpful to visit their work place or meet with co-workers before Normal Text: their first official working day, to help them cope with their own and others’ reactions in Normal Text: advance. Heading 3: WHAT ABOUT DISCIPLINE/BEHAVIOR? Normal Text: A return to usual discipline within the family is part of returning to the “new normal.” Normal Text: When a child is ill, it is easy to let family rules slip. However, by insisting on good Normal Text: behavior, parents can send a very positive message to both the child who was sick Normal Text: and their brothers and sisters that the family is getting back to normal routines and Normal Text: expectations. This helps the whole family remember that they have a future after cancer. Heading 3: WHAT WILL SCHOOL BE LIKE FOR MY CHILD? Normal Text: Most children with cancer continue attending school during therapy. A classroom Normal Text: discussion or just sharing the news of ending treatment with their close friends is Normal Text: appropriate. Children who missed large amounts of school due to treatment or side Normal Text: effects may need time to readjust.

You may Normal Text: also want to get help from the school counselor, psychologist or social worker, or a Normal Text: school specialist at the hospital. Normal Text: Many children find it hard to go back to school, especially if they have changes in Normal Text: their body. Hair loss and weight loss or weight gain are common concerns. Tell your Normal Text: health care team if your child is worried about going back to school. Your child life Normal Text: specialist, social worker, psychologist or nurse may be able to help. If your child is having Normal Text: problems doing school work, ask for extra help. There are two laws in the United States Normal Text: that assist children treated for cancer to receive needed services at school, including Normal Text: an Individualized Education Plan (IEP). These laws are called IDEA (Individuals with Normal Text: Disabilities Education Act) and Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act. Talk with someone Normal Text: from your health care team to see how these laws, or the laws in your country, may Normal Text: apply to your child. Heading 3: WHAT ABOUT DIET? Normal Text: Your child’s nutrition and diet may have been affected by cancer Normal Text: treatment. If your child was treated with steroid medicines, they Normal Text: may have developed a craving for salty, unhealthy foods and Normal Text: gained excess weight. Children who received treatment that Normal Text: caused mouth sores, nausea, or diarrhea may have experienced Normal Text: weight loss and developed food aversions (avoiding certain Normal Text: foods). A gradual return to a healthy, normal diet should be the goal. Now is the time Normal Text: to stop high calorie snacking and high sodium foods that may have been eaten during Normal Text: treatment. Your child should be encouraged to eat a variety of foods from all food Normal Text: groups each day. Resist the urge to offer high calorie, empty nutrition foods to children Normal Text: who are underweight. Your clinical dietician is able to help with meal suggestions and Normal Text: menu planning. A healthy diet, including a healthy balance of protein, carbohydrates, Normal Text: fats, vitamins, and minerals is an important part of helping your child’s body to grow, Normal Text: heal, and work well. Of course, this is the best way for the whole family to eat! Heading 3: WHAT ABOUT VITAMIN SUPPLEMENTS AND OVER-THE-COUNTER Heading 3: MEDICINES? Normal Text: Vitamin supplements are not a replacement for good eating habits. They may be used Normal Text: for children who are unable to tolerate certain food groups, such as milk, or who have Normal Text: low levels of nutrients, such as vitamin D. Some health care providers recommend a Normal Text: daily multivitamin. Check with your health care provider about multivitamin use.

Patients who have undergone Normal Text: a hematopoietic stem cell transplant may have a longer period of immune system Normal Text: recovery. Heading 3: WHAT DO I DO IF MY CHILD DEVELOPS A FEVER, OR BECOMES ILL? Normal Text: After 6 months off therapy, fevers and minor illnesses generally are handled as they Normal Text: would be for any child. This may mean comfort care like bed rest, acetaminophen (such Normal Text: as Tylenol Normal Text: ® Normal Text: ), or a visit to the pediatrician if fever is 101˚ F or more, or if the child appears Normal Text: very ill. It will be hard not to worry when your child has a sore throat or headache Normal Text: even though the most likely cause is a normal childhood illness. For parents of children Normal Text: treated for cancer, minor illness may be very stressful, as it is not easy to keep “normal” Normal Text: childhood illnesses in perspective.

Normal Text: We encourage your child to return to normal activities as soon as they feel able, Normal Text: although some children are left with lasting effects from the cancer or treatment and Normal Text: may not be able to do all they could do before treatment. There may be some activity Normal Text: restrictions based on your child’s treatment. For example, some health care providers Normal Text: discourage heavy weight lifting for patients who received high doses of chemotherapy Normal Text: medicines called anthracyclines (such as doxorubicin or daunorubicin). Talk to your Normal Text: health care provider about specific limits for your child. Heading 3: WHAT ABOUT IMMUNIZATIONS? Normal Text: Chemotherapy used in conventional doses (not doses used for hematopoietic stem cell Normal Text: transplant) usually does not destroy the immunity gained from immunizations given Normal Text: before the cancer. That means that often there is no need to repeat immunizations Normal Text: that were already given. Your health care provider may test your child to see if any Normal Text: boosters are needed. Many children, especially young children, may have had their Normal Text: routine immunization schedule interrupted during treatment. Most children are able Normal Text: to begin catching up any missed immunizations within 6 to 12 months of the end of Normal Text: treatment. Your health care provider will talk with you about when your child can have Normal Text: immunizations again. Heading 3: WHO ARE MY BEST SUPPORT SYSTEMS? Normal Text: Some people find the end of treatment a positive time when they need much less Normal Text: support, but others find this time unsettling. Communication with your partner or Normal Text: spouse (or a trusted supportive person) at this time is essential. The need to talk about Normal Text: feelings, fears, appreciation, and information remains after cancer treatment ends. Normal Text: Silence can make you feel separated from your partner and loved ones. By sharing Normal Text: feelings and information, you can stay connected and be better able to make decisions. Normal Text: Keep in contact with people who have been close to you, and who let you be honest Normal Text: about your feelings. Talking to others can help you to think more clearly. The staff you Normal Text: met during treatment will be aware of the difficulties parents and young people face at Normal Text: the end of treatment. Please talk with them if you feel you need some extra support at Normal Text: this time. Some treatment centers have parent support groups. When these groups are Normal Text: not available, there may be more general cancer support groups in your area. Ask your Normal Text: child’s health care team about available support in your area. The organizations listed at Normal Text: the end of this section will also guide you to what counseling services are available in Normal Text: your area.

Normal Text: Anniversaries of the time of diagnosis or finishing treatment can be very emotional, and Normal Text: for many parents, create feelings of both sadness and joy. In time, many parents find Normal Text: that they can reach a balance between being thankful that their child is free from cancer Normal Text: and the sadness over the inevitable losses the experience has brought. Some families will Normal Text: have to come to terms with many such losses, particularly when children have lasting Normal Text: effects from the cancer treatment. Heading 2: One Year Off Treatment and Beyond Normal Text: The “one year off therapy anniversary” is a significant time for many families. Blood Normal Text: counts and immune system have recovered, and hair has returned if it is going to. Normal Text: Children usually have more energy and may be experiencing “catch up” growth. For Normal Text: many children, there is no longer any physical evidence of cancer treatment, but for Normal Text: others the lasting effects of cancer treatment may now be apparent. Heading 3: WHY DO WE STILL NEED TO COME BACK TO THE CLINIC? Normal Text: The focus of clinic visits during the second year after treatment ends will be slightly Normal Text: different. The health care team will continue to monitor your child, but the intervals Normal Text: between visits lengthen. Blood tests and scans may be done to be certain that the Normal Text: cancer is gone. The health care team will also concentrate on restoring your child to Normal Text: a state of good health. Talk with your health care provider about your child’s specific Normal Text: follow-up plan. After 2 to 5 years, your child’s care may be transitioned to the hospital’s Normal Text: long-term follow-up clinic. Heading 3: HOW SHOULD I TALK TO MY CHILD ABOUT THE ILLNESS? Normal Text: As your child grows up, the amount of information that they need about their illness Normal Text: and its treatment increases. Often, children were too young to remember much about Normal Text: the treatment period. It can be tempting to try to protect your child from the anxiety you Normal Text: feel by not sharing more information about the illness. Children are usually more aware Normal Text: than adults realize. Many children will learn about their illness from comments made by Normal Text: older brothers and sisters, relatives, or friends. Finding out about the illness in this way Normal Text: can mean that they only have part of the story. This may leave them with worries. Fears Normal Text: can be increased if a child cannot talk with a parent about their feelings, concerns, and Normal Text: questions. Normal Text: It may be hard for your child to ask you about cancer if you never mention it. By talking Normal Text: openly to your child, you are inviting them to share their thoughts about the illness Normal Text: openly too.

Normal Text: For some children, intellectual development may be affected by reduced energy levels Normal Text: during treatment and prolonged absences from school. Treatment to manage or Normal Text: prevent disease in the brain may affect memory and learning abilities. Children who Normal Text: had treatment for a brain tumor are more likely to receive treatments that may affect Normal Text: learning and memory. If your child received this type of treatment, let the teacher, Normal Text: principal, and school counselor know. Normal Text: Some parents and teachers report that children who received therapy to the central Normal Text: nervous system may have difficulty concentrating. The brain is a very complex structure Normal Text: that continues to grow and develop throughout childhood, adolescence, and young Normal Text: adulthood. Neuropsychological testing may help identify learning weaknesses and Normal Text: strengths and help the school give your child extra support so that they can reach their Normal Text: full educational potential. Normal Text: School difficulties may not appear for years after treatment is completed. Any academic Normal Text: difficulties should be discussed with the health care team, school psychologist or Normal Text: reintegration specialist, and your child’s school.

Some children have ongoing problems with nutrition and Normal Text: maintaining a healthy weight. Most children will begin to gain weight once treatment Normal Text: is ended, and as a parent, this will be very reassuring. However, some children may gain Normal Text: weight at an unhealthy rate. If your child experiences any weight or nutritional issues Normal Text: please discuss this with your health care team. Meeting with a dietician may also be Normal Text: helpful.

The COG conducts bench-to-bedside Normal Text: research by developing new treatments and conducting clinical trials that translate Normal Text: scientific discoveries into cures.

This means that every child and care team has complete Normal Text: access to the latest research and world-class treatments at hospitals close to home. Heading 3: WHY IS COLLABORATIVE RESEARCH IMPORTANT? Normal Text: While nearly 13,500 children and adolescents are diagnosed with cancer each year in Normal Text: the United States, there are many different kinds of children’s cancer. The number of Normal Text: children with each type of cancer is relatively small.
